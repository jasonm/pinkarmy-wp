Recently I  entered the &quot;mad scientist&quot; Design-a-Biobrick contest to see how actual &quot;DIY&quot; is possible in with synthetic biology (I received an honorable mention).  In the process, I learned more about biology and the wetware involved in genetically modified organisms, and most importantly came to the not-so-startling conclusion:<br/><br/>The hype of synthetic biology and &quot;garage hacking genetics&quot; is greatly exaggerated.<br/><br/>In truth, it does require nearly a graduate degree PLUS a scientific-quality-level research laboratory in order to actually get anything to work.  And even in that case where individuals are so equipped, getting anything to grow, let alone perform and/or activate the &quot;newly designed&quot; biological function, is a very rare feat indeed.<br/><br/>Thus, actual garage hacking of biology is still some number of years off, especially for those outside the technically trained lab tech, graduate level or Ph.D. trained field.  Since right now it&#39;s the end of 2008, that means garage biology labs are still very difficult until 2012 or so.<br/><br/>The best way, today, in my opinion, to get trained on this technology, in order to actually hack and/or build anything, is to probably spend a year towards &quot;professional/graduate biotech lab training&quot; oriented community college classes.  This would include a couple bio classes, an organic chem class, and a bunch of lab training in a real lab.  After 15 to 30 credits worth of training, then it will likely be at least possible to hack something in the garage -- whether or not it grows is up to the DNA and the protocols.',0,'1','','',0,0),(5,5,'Jason Bobe','','','','2008-10-01 12:05:00','2008-10-01 17:05:00','Hi Jonathan -<br/><br/>Thanks for the comment.  There is no doubt that amateur biology is in its early days.  The types of activities/protocols that are practical and accessible at this moment are limited.  <br/><br/>This being said, the challenge today is to identify areas where amateurs can contribute with basic materials, equipment, and training (and this may not be in synbio right now).  Bioinformatics and <a HREF=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/22/science/22fish.html\" REL=\"nofollow\">exploratory biology</a> are two areas where individuals can make contributions today.<br/><br/>RE: classes, I think there may be an opportunity for local training seminars that target individuals who are not professionally inclined, but want to learn technical skills.  Similar to <a HREF=\"http://www.thecrucible.org\" REL=\"nofollow\">The Crucible</a> in Berkeley.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Jason',0,'1','','',0,0),(6,5,'Mackenzie','','','','2008-10-01 19:07:00','2008-10-02 00:07:00','Indeed, one of our primary goals is to build a biology workshop where biotech enthusiasts can do real labwork.  By pooling resources and developing safety and regulatory expertise - with a lot of help and advice from existing labs and institutions - I believe we can set up labs for people who would otherwise not have access to the resources because the are too expensive and difficult to pull together individually.  Additionally, I have confidence that the amazing mix of people that make up the diybio community will rise to the challenge of building a lab on a shoestring and come up with inexpensive and innovative techniques and tools that will enable the typical range of biological operations a traditional academic lab can support.  This will help the development of labs in developing countries, which will help local scientists and entrepreneurs solve local problems.<br/><br/>Additionally, I think our nascent community has the potential to make significant contributions to biological knowledge by investigating non-traditional systems and lifeforms.<br/><br/>Amateur biologists could make significant contributions to biology in general, and synthetic biology in particular, by 1) investigating organisms outside of the handful of already well-characterized model organisms (i.e. P. patens [moss] or halobacteria), and 2) by using existing standardized biological parts, building novel standard biological parts, developing new methods to easily measure biopart activity, and perhaps the lowest-hanging fruit of all: simply characterizing existing parts with existing measurement standards.  Your typical grant-funded synthetic biology grad student may not have the leeway or motivation to do so - but we hobbyists could make a big difference to the toolbox of available standard biological parts by characterizing them.  Almost no one else will.<br/> <br/>So in conclusion, I think amateur biologists could make a big impact immediately by working together in communal workshops.  Next time you are in Boston, you should stop by and try out our facilities :)',0,'1','','',0,0);

Er, I mean the four core devs.&#8221;</p>\n<p>These sentiments, and others like them, are the focus of today&#8217;s post. Setting aside the similarities between Ryan, Andrew, Mark and Peter to Charlie&#8217;s Angels for a moment, the question of how decisions about features are made needs to be addressed. There are a number of mechanisms in place for communication between the community and the core team, but with so many different channels, it&#8217;s hard to keep up with them all and still focus on production. Here&#8217;s where we are now&#8230;</p>\n<p><strong>#wordpress-dev IRC channel</strong>: The IRC channel used to be more active. These days there&#8217;s rarely more than a dozen or two people online at any given time, and hours go by with no activity. When a question pops up, it&#8217;s often a tech question from a less experienced developer or site manager looking for help, as opposed to ongoing discussions about the best way to approach core code and features.

Recruiting may mean hiring an agency to find participants, but for testing WordPress, it makes more sense to recruit from within this community, so that means making a screening survey, reading all the responses, segmenting the respondents into categories and contacting people until you&#8217;ve filled your desired quotas (for whatever segments you&#8217;re seeking, such as newbie, experienced user, developer, CMS user, photoblogger, mobile user, etc. ).

When the sessions are complete, the results are analyzed. All the notes and videos are reviewed, patterns are identified, and ultimately a report is written and the feedback informs the next round of revisions.</p>\n<p>Some people think it shouldn&#8217;t take much time to do all this. I&#8217;ve lost count of the number of people who cite <a href=\"http://www.useit.com/alertbox/20000319.html\">an old article by Jakob Nielsen</a> that says you don&#8217;t need to test with more than 5 users because usability issues become clear right away. While I&#8217;ve found that to be generally true, when your user base is as diverse in experience level, usage, platform  configuration, language (right to left languages have a pretty different experience) and demography as the WordPress community is, 5 users really isn&#8217;t enough to get a clear picture.

Now there is: <a href=\"http://buddypress.org/\">check out BuddyPress</a>.</p>\n<p>BuddyPress is an official sister project of WordPress.

I was also thinking maybe the favorites menu should drop down into the white h2 area by screen options/help tabs.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Ryan: </strong>Menu color to the top with blog title pushed over and favorites next to screen options sounds quite nice.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Jane: </strong>I&#8217;ll ask Matt Thomas if he could style it <em>[ed. note: Matt Thomas created the visual style for 2.7]</em>, and we can see what people think, maybe post on <a href=\"http://wpdevel.wordpress.com/\">wpdevel</a> for feedback.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Ryan: </strong>If it&#8217;s quick, maybe we could even get it into 2.8.</p>\n<h4>ACT II</h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Matt T: </strong>Here are some comps based on what you told me.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Jane: </strong>Cool, but where are Screen Options and Help tabs?</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Matt T: </strong>Still working on that.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Jane: </strong>Hm. Wonder if there&#8217;s time to open this up to community designers? I know we&#8217;re in freeze, and it&#8217;s no notice, but you didn&#8217;t get any notice either when we dropped this styling request on your lap a few hours ago. That&#8217;s the way open software development works: sometimes the best ideas come at the last minute!</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Matt T:</strong> I&#8217;m all for letting the community take a stab at it. Especially if they come up with something brilliant to do with the Screen Options and Help tabs.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Jane: </strong>I&#8217;ll ask Ryan about release date and see if there&#8217;s time. I know they wanted your style recommendations today.</p>\n<h4>Act III</h4>\n<p><strong>Ryan: </strong>Tuesday is probably doable, no later than that for final delivery of style and any gradient graphics, etc.</p>\n<p><strong>Jane: </strong>Awesome! People will hate me for the short notice after the has-patch marathon, but since it&#8217;s a small project and over the weekend, and wasn&#8217;t even something anyone was planning until a few hours ago, I&#8217;m <strong>*really hoping*</strong> people will take this for what it is, an attempt to give more people input into an upcoming visual change in the interface, even if it&#8217;s not a huge one.</p>\n<p><strong>Ryan:</strong> Would have the benefit of warning people that header and menu will be changed a bit.</p>\n<p><strong>Jane:</strong> And we can have a vote. If I can get all the materials together and post in the morning, that would give 2 days of design time for submissions on Monday, and if we do a day of voting Tuesday, that&#8217;s 3 days notice for the vote. I&#8217;ll make sure to post to all the lists, etc.</p>\n<p><strong>Ryan: </strong>Will we announce with comps from Matt T as examples of what we&#8217;re thinking?</p>\n<p><strong>Jane:</strong> I&#8217;ll write up the UX reasons for considering the change, and Matt T can provide some style guidelines and his original comps so no one will have to waste time mocking up the basic screen layout.</p>\n<p><strong>Ryan:</strong> That would help set the scope. We just want tweaks here and there, given the timing.</p>\n<p><strong>Jane: </strong>Woot!</p>\n<p><strong>On Your Mark, Get Set&#8230;</strong><br />\nOkay, so here&#8217;s the deal. Modifying the nav/header to be a little nicer is was a last-minute design idea, and if it can&#8217;t be worked out in the time we have left before 2.8 (which is very little), we&#8217;ll just wait until 2.9 to work on it. But!

Might need some styling help. I was also thinking maybe the favorites menu should drop down into the white h2 area by screen options/help tabs.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Ryan: </strong>Menu color to the top with blog title pushed over and favorites next to screen options sounds quite nice.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Jane: </strong>I&#8217;ll ask Matt Thomas if he could style it <em>[ed. note: Matt Thomas created the visual style for 2.7]</em>, and we can see what people think, maybe post on <a href=\"http://wpdevel.wordpress.com/\">wpdevel</a> for feedback.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Ryan: </strong>If it&#8217;s quick, maybe we could even get it into 2.8.</p>\n<h4>ACT II</h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Matt T: </strong>Here are some comps based on what you told me.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Jane: </strong>Cool, but where are Screen Options and Help tabs?</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Matt T: </strong>Still working on that.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Jane: </strong>Hm. Wonder if there&#8217;s time to open this up to community designers? I know we&#8217;re in freeze, and it&#8217;s no notice, but you didn&#8217;t get any notice either when we dropped this styling request on your lap a few hours ago. That&#8217;s the way open software development works: sometimes the best ideas come at the last minute!</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Matt T:</strong> I&#8217;m all for letting the community take a stab at it. Especially if they come up with something brilliant to do with the Screen Options and Help tabs.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Jane: </strong>I&#8217;ll ask Ryan about release date and see if there&#8217;s time. I know they wanted your style recommendations today.</p>\n<h4>Act III</h4>\n<p><strong>Ryan: </strong>Tuesday is probably doable, no later than that for final delivery of style and any gradient graphics, etc.</p>\n<p><strong>Jane: </strong>Awesome! People will hate me for the short notice after the has-patch marathon, but since it&#8217;s a small project and over the weekend, and wasn&#8217;t even something anyone was planning until a few hours ago, I&#8217;m <strong>*really hoping*</strong> people will take this for what it is, an attempt to give more people input into an upcoming visual change in the interface, even if it&#8217;s not a huge one.</p>\n<p><strong>Ryan:</strong> Would have the benefit of warning people that header and menu will be changed a bit.</p>\n<p><strong>Jane:</strong> And we can have a vote. If I can get all the materials together and post in the morning, that would give 2 days of design time for submissions on Monday, and if we do a day of voting Tuesday, that&#8217;s 3 days notice for the vote. I&#8217;ll make sure to post to all the lists, etc.</p>\n<p><strong>Ryan: </strong>Will we announce with comps from Matt T as examples of what we&#8217;re thinking?</p>\n<p><strong>Jane:</strong> I&#8217;ll write up the UX reasons for considering the change, and Matt T can provide some style guidelines and his original comps so no one will have to waste time mocking up the basic screen layout.</p>\n<p><strong>Ryan:</strong> That would help set the scope. We just want tweaks here and there, given the timing.</p>\n<p><strong>Jane: </strong>Woot!</p>\n<p><strong>On Your Mark, Get Set&#8230;</strong><br />\nOkay, so here&#8217;s the deal. Modifying the nav/header to be a little nicer is was a last-minute design idea, and if it can&#8217;t be worked out in the time we have left before 2.8 (which is very little), we&#8217;ll just wait until 2.9 to work on it. But! If someone comes up with something the community really likes and it doesn&#8217;t break any of the design guidelines for the rest of WordPress, we could sneak it in.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://wordpress.org/development/?page_id=661\">UX and design guidelines for this mini-project are posted here</a> (so as not to clog up anyone&#8217;s feed reader with big graphics).

Rather than answer them all individually and privately, I&#8217;m putting it up for all to see.</p>\n<h3>Become involved with the development community</h3>\n<p>Join <a href=\"http://lists.automattic.com/mailman/listinfo/wp-hackers\">the wp-hackers mailing list</a>. Participate when you have something useful to say, or an interesting question/problem to pose to other WP developers. Dive in at <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/support/\">the WP support forums</a>. Find someone with an interesting problem, and solve it for them. If it&#8217;s a notable issue, write a blog post about how to solve the issue. Which brings me to the next task&#8230;</p>\n<h3>Blog about WordPress</h3>\n<p><strong>I&#8217;m doing this right now!</strong> Not only is it deliciously &#8220;meta,&#8221; it can raise your profile and help you connect with other WordPress developers and users. Write about a problem you solved, or a challenge you&#8217;d like to see addressed by WordPress core or a WordPress plugin. And don&#8217;t forget to blog about the plugins you write&#8230;</p>\n<h3>Write a bunch of useful plugins</h3>\n<p>This is probably the best thing you can do to get noticed by clients. Write a useful plugin and you&#8217;ll be getting business leads for years to come. You don&#8217;t have to write a really big, complicated plugin. Write something that will make using WordPress easier, more fun, more efficient, and people will remember you. It might be good to have one more ambitious plugin to serve as an example of your skills, but certainly don&#8217;t shy away from brevity. Some of the favorite things I&#8217;ve written are between 1 and 50 lines of code. Users don&#8217;t care about how big a plugin is. They just want it to serve a need. Go ahead and scratch their itch. Hint: monitor Google or Twitter for people saying &#8220;I want a WordPress plugin&#8230;&#8221; to get an idea of the sorts of needs that are currently unfulfilled.</p>\n<h3>Contribute to WordPress core</h3>\n<p>Contributing to the WordPress core software helps you in two ways. First, it provides continuing education. WordPress is constantly evolving, and you need to stay sharp! This is a great way to learn about (and influence) the direction of the WordPress codebase. Second, it raises your profile in the WordPress community (both the developer and user communities). Be sure to blog about your WordPress core contributions. <a href=\"http://core.trac.wordpress.org/\">Trac</a> is a great place to start. Maintain a calm demeanor, and don&#8217;t get too big for your britches. Don&#8217;t be the person who comes in and embarrasses themselves by closing a ticket as &#8220;WONTFIX&#8221; that was opened by a seasoned developer! Watch how other tickets evolve and you&#8217;ll figure out how it works.</p>\n<h3>Stay in contact with more seasoned developers</h3>\n<p>A lot of us are busy, but we try to make time to mentor people. We&#8217;re all well-served by a vibrant development marketplace. Don&#8217;t be afraid to contact a more experienced developer for advice. The worst that will happen is that you&#8217;ll get ignored &#8212; apologies to anyone who is in my e-mail limbo&#8230; resend it if it&#8217;s been more than a few weeks!</p>\n<p>And as you get more experienced:</p>\n<h3>Speak at WordCamps and other events</h3>\n<p>Once you&#8217;ve gained enough kudos in the WP community, you&#8217;ll likely be asked to talk at a WordCamp event. And if you haven&#8217;t, and you think you could bring something special to the event, go ahead and ask if they need any more speakers! This will raise your profile further, introduce you to really cool people, and provide you with a bunch of business leads. BarCamps, social media gatherings, and other such events are also worth attending. The point isn&#8217;t to get up there and give a business pitch. In fact, your life might be in danger if you pull that stunt at a BarCamp. The point is to impart knowledge, connect with people, while letting your skills expose themselves naturally. And pitch away when you&#8217;re chatting up potential leads between sessions.</p>\n<h3>Charge according to your skill set and experience</h3>\n<p>Several years ago, I had the quasi-embarrassing surprise of being given a voluntary 75% per-hour raise by a client. I think they were afraid that my skills had outpaced my rate, and that I was going to get wooed away by a new client at a higher rate. Don&#8217;t make the mistake of charging too little. In fact, publish higher rates than you actually think you&#8217;re worth, and allow people to haggle you down (a little). And every time you get booked up and have to turn away business, raise your rate. If you&#8217;re in that much demand, you&#8217;re not charging enough.</p>\n<h3>Find a niche</h3>\n<p>But not WordPress security. That&#8217;s mine. <img src=\"http://s.wordpress.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":-)\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /> </p>\n<p>A WordPress development niche is a niche within a niche. And that means you can charge more for your more specialized skills. Examples: migrating data to WordPress. Feed kung-fu. Re-implementing a design from another system. Custom write-panel plugins. Sidebar widgets.</p>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/markjaquith.wordpress.com/310/\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/markjaquith.wordpress.com/310/\" /></a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/godelicious/markjaquith.wordpress.com/310/\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/delicious/markjaquith.wordpress.com/310/\" /></a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gostumble/markjaquith.wordpress.com/310/\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/stumble/markjaquith.wordpress.com/310/\" /></a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/godigg/markjaquith.wordpress.com/310/\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/digg/markjaquith.wordpress.com/310/\" /></a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/goreddit/markjaquith.wordpress.com/310/\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/reddit/markjaquith.wordpress.com/310/\" /></a> <img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=markjaquith.wordpress.com&blog=316&post=310&subd=markjaquith&ref=&feed=1\" /></div>\";s:7:\"pubdate\";s:31:\"Sun, 07 Jun 2009 03:57:01 +0000\";s:2:\"dc\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";s:12:\"Mark Jaquith\";}s:7:\"summary\";s:6515:\"<div class=\"snap_preview\"><br /><p>I&#8217;ve had a bunch of people ask me how they could get started as a WordPress developer or consultant.

It might be good to have one more ambitious plugin to serve as an example of your skills, but certainly don&#8217;t shy away from brevity. Some of the favorite things I&#8217;ve written are between 1 and 50 lines of code. Users don&#8217;t care about how big a plugin is. They just want it to serve a need. Go ahead and scratch their itch. Hint: monitor Google or Twitter for people saying &#8220;I want a WordPress plugin&#8230;&#8221; to get an idea of the sorts of needs that are currently unfulfilled.</p>\n<h3>Contribute to WordPress core</h3>\n<p>Contributing to the WordPress core software helps you in two ways. First, it provides continuing education. WordPress is constantly evolving, and you need to stay sharp! This is a great way to learn about (and influence) the direction of the WordPress codebase. Second, it raises your profile in the WordPress community (both the developer and user communities). Be sure to blog about your WordPress core contributions. <a href=\"http://core.trac.wordpress.org/\">Trac</a> is a great place to start. Maintain a calm demeanor, and don&#8217;t get too big for your britches. Don&#8217;t be the person who comes in and embarrasses themselves by closing a ticket as &#8220;WONTFIX&#8221; that was opened by a seasoned developer! Watch how other tickets evolve and you&#8217;ll figure out how it works.</p>\n<h3>Stay in contact with more seasoned developers</h3>\n<p>A lot of us are busy, but we try to make time to mentor people. We&#8217;re all well-served by a vibrant development marketplace. Don&#8217;t be afraid to contact a more experienced developer for advice. The worst that will happen is that you&#8217;ll get ignored &#8212; apologies to anyone who is in my e-mail limbo&#8230; resend it if it&#8217;s been more than a few weeks!</p>\n<p>And as you get more experienced:</p>\n<h3>Speak at WordCamps and other events</h3>\n<p>Once you&#8217;ve gained enough kudos in the WP community, you&#8217;ll likely be asked to talk at a WordCamp event. And if you haven&#8217;t, and you think you could bring something special to the event, go ahead and ask if they need any more speakers! This will raise your profile further, introduce you to really cool people, and provide you with a bunch of business leads. BarCamps, social media gatherings, and other such events are also worth attending. The point isn&#8217;t to get up there and give a business pitch. In fact, your life might be in danger if you pull that stunt at a BarCamp. The point is to impart knowledge, connect with people, while letting your skills expose themselves naturally. And pitch away when you&#8217;re chatting up potential leads between sessions.</p>\n<h3>Charge according to your skill set and experience</h3>\n<p>Several years ago, I had the quasi-embarrassing surprise of being given a voluntary 75% per-hour raise by a client. I think they were afraid that my skills had outpaced my rate, and that I was going to get wooed away by a new client at a higher rate. Don&#8217;t make the mistake of charging too little. In fact, publish higher rates than you actually think you&#8217;re worth, and allow people to haggle you down (a little). And every time you get booked up and have to turn away business, raise your rate. If you&#8217;re in that much demand, you&#8217;re not charging enough.</p>\n<h3>Find a niche</h3>\n<p>But not WordPress security. That&#8217;s mine. <img src=\"http://s.wordpress.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":-)\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /> </p>\n<p>A WordPress development niche is a niche within a niche. And that means you can charge more for your more specialized skills. Examples: migrating data to WordPress. Feed kung-fu. Re-implementing a design from another system. Custom write-panel plugins. Sidebar widgets.</p>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/markjaquith.wordpress.com/310/\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/markjaquith.wordpress.com/310/\" /></a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/godelicious/markjaquith.wordpress.com/310/\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/delicious/markjaquith.wordpress.com/310/\" /></a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gostumble/markjaquith.wordpress.com/310/\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/stumble/markjaquith.wordpress.com/310/\" /></a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/godigg/markjaquith.wordpress.com/310/\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/digg/markjaquith.wordpress.com/310/\" /></a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/goreddit/markjaquith.wordpress.com/310/\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/reddit/markjaquith.wordpress.com/310/\" /></a> <img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=markjaquith.wordpress.com&blog=316&post=310&subd=markjaquith&ref=&feed=1\" /></div>\";}i:1;a:7:{s:5:\"title\";s:41:\"Alex King: WordPress Mobile Edition 3.0.5\";s:4:\"guid\";s:64:\"http://alexking.org/blog/2009/06/06/wordpress-mobile-edition-305\";s:4:\"link\";s:64:\"http://alexking.org/blog/2009/06/06/wordpress-mobile-edition-305\";s:11:\"description\";s:1287:\"<p>I&#8217;ve released a new version of my WordPress Mobile Edition plugin.

That was the longest time I know of when people could consistently access WordPress.com from across China.</p>\n<p>Part of the Chinese government&#8217;s approach seems to be to sometimes allow western hotels access and other specific points &#8212; likely to deceive Westerners and cause confusion.</p>\n<p>There does not seem to be a reliable way to automate detection of WordPress.com being blocked, regardless of what tools might promise. I&#8217;m not surprised that <a href=\"http://greatfirewallofchina.org/\">http://greatfirewallofchina.org/</a> gave up. This is the message on the site&#8217;s homepage:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Because of the ever stricter measures of censorship China imposes on the Internet, the team of www.greatfirewallofchina.org at present can no longer vouch for the reliability of its test tool.

We want the WordPress for iPhone application to be the best mobile blogging tool on the iPhone.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;d like to invite you into the thought process currently going on inside our collective heads.</p>\n<h2>Thinking Out Loud</h2>\n<p>First impressions count, it&#8217;s what I&#8217;d like to focus on right now. When you open WordPress for the first time you&#8217;re greeted with this screen:</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-369\" title=\"home screen\" src=\"http://wpiphone.files.wordpress.com/2009/05/home-screen.png?w=320&#038;h=480\" alt=\"home screen\" width=\"320\" height=\"480\" /></p>\n<p>You have two options:</p>\n<ol>\n<li> &#8220;Set up your blog&#8221;</li>\n<li> &#8220;About WordPress for iPhone&#8221;</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The second option is interesting, but I&#8217;m not sure why it gets equal billing on the home screen when all anyone wants to do the first time they open the application is to set up their blog.</p>\n<p>The &#8220;Add Blog&#8221; screen should be shown by default if you haven&#8217;t already added one:</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-368\" title=\"add a blog\" src=\"http://wpiphone.files.wordpress.com/2009/05/add-a-blog.png?w=320&#038;h=480\" alt=\"add a blog\" width=\"320\" height=\"480\" /></p>\n<p>Speaking of which, the cursor should already be placed in the &#8220;Blog URL&#8221; field and the keyboard should be displayed. There shouldn&#8217;t be an option to cancel as the application is unusable without at least one blog present.</p>\n<p>The &#8220;Save&#8221; button should be disabled until the &#8220;Blog URL&#8221;, &#8220;User Name&#8221; and &#8220;Password&#8221; fields have been filled in. They keyboards return key should say &#8220;Next&#8221; instead of &#8220;Done&#8221;, it should jump into the next field I need to fill in.</p>\n<p>It should change to &#8220;Done&#8221; only when I&#8217;ve entered all the required fields. At the same time the &#8220;Save&#8221; button should become enabled. In fact the &#8220;Save&#8221; button should probably read &#8220;Done&#8221; as well. Something like this:</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-371\" title=\"saving\" src=\"http://wpiphone.files.wordpress.com/2009/05/saving.png?w=320&#038;h=480\" alt=\"saving\" width=\"320\" height=\"480\" /></p>\n<p>When I&#8217;m done, I want useful feedback. Currently there is a spinning icon in the top right hand corner where the &#8220;Save&#8221; button used to be. But the keyboard is still present unless I hid it while entering my details. For all intents and purposes this screen still looks like it&#8217;s in an editable state. Except the application doesn&#8217;t respond at all!  As a user, I require a clear indication of what is happening, otherwise confusion ensues, so we&#8217;ll fix that too.</p>\n<p>After I click &#8220;Done&#8221; I&#8217;m back on the home screen. Why is that? Rather than adding another blog, it seems much more likely to us that you&#8217;ll want to start using the app to manage the blog you just added, so we&#8217;ll show the &#8220;Posts/Pages/Comments&#8221; screen instead.  You can add the rest of your blogs later.</p>\n<h3>Moving Forward</h3>\n<p>As you can see we&#8217;ve been doing a lot of thinking, scrutinising and playing with ideas. We&#8217;ve already started adding these changes to the <a href=\"http://iphone.svn.wordpress.org/trunk/\">Subversion repository</a> in the user-interface-rewrite branch.</p>\n<p>They say you need to walk before you can run, let alone fly. Right now we&#8217;re still crawling, but here&#8217;s a sneak peak into the changes that we&#8217;ve got planned for the future:</p>\n<h3>User Interface Overhaul</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Home Screen</li>\n<li>Adding a Blog</li>\n<li>Editing a Blog</li>\n<li>Removing a Blog</li>\n<li>Change blog screen to use tab-bar navigation</li>\n<li>Changing the way local drafts work and are represented</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Comment Moderation</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Activity Dashboard &#8211; Stream of consciousness for activity on a given blog</li>\n<li>Ability to quickly approve/delete/mark as spam</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Statefulness</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Remember which blog I was working in.

How do you spend yours?</p>\n<p>So on to the “five”.</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp125/\">WP125</a> – This is a great plugin that can be used in two manners.&#160; One is for selling your own ad space for 125 x 125 graphic ads or you can use it as I do and link to affiliate sites you are a member of.

are shouting out for one in their area. <a title=\"Copenhagen\" href=\"http://wordpress.meetup.com/cities/dk/copenhagen/\">Copenhagen</a> (61 interested), <a title=\"Philadelphia, PA\"

title=\"London\" href=\"http://wordpress.meetup.com/cities/gb/london/\">London</a>, and <a title=\"Denver, CO\" href=\"http://wordpress.meetup.com/cities/us/co/denver/\">Denver</a> are among the many. Some of these have had or are about to have a WordCamp event, so why aren&#8217;t there regular WordPress meetups?</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://lorelle.files.wordpress.com/2009/05/wordcampmeetups-map.jpg\"><img src=\"http://lorelle.files.wordpress.com/2009/05/wordcampmeetups-map.jpg?w=300&#038;h=263\" alt=\"WordCamp Meetups Map at Meetups.com\" title=\"WordCamp Meetups Map at Meetups.com\" width=\"300\" height=\"263\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-4101\" /></a><a title=\"WordPress Meetup Groups\" href=\"http://wordpress.meetup.com/\">WordPress Meetup Groups</a> on Meetup.com offers a map of all the places where there are WordPress events and activities and where ones are wanted. You can <a title=\"browse all cities\" href=\"http://wordpress.meetup.com/cities/\">browse a list of cities hosting WordPress events</a> or go directly to your region to find out where one is or who might be interested in putting one together.</p>\n<h3>What is the Difference Between a WordPress Meetup and WordCamp?</h3>\n<p>A WordPress Meetup is a frequent meeting of WordPress fans. If you would like to start a WordPress Meetup group, find a meeting place and announce it among your friends, and add a listing to the <a title=\"Event search for wordpress\" href=\"http://upcoming.yahoo.com/search/?type=Events&amp;q=wordpress\">Yahoo Upcoming events for WordPress</a> and <a title=\"WordPress upcoming events\" href=\"http://wordpress.meetup.com/events/upcoming/\">WordPress Meetups Upcoming Events</a> and tag them &#8220;WordPress Events&#8221; and &#8220;WordPress&#8221;, as many track WordPress event announcements there.</p>\n<p>A WordPress Meetup allows locals to get together and learn from each other on how to use WordPress. There are formal WordPress meetups and informal ones, covering nothing but WordPress or including WordPress as part of other topics on web publishing and social media. WordPress meetups are usually held monthly or quarterly. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://lorelle.files.wordpress.com/2009/01/img_49361.jpg\"><img src=\"http://lorelle.files.wordpress.com/2009/01/img_49361.jpg?w=300&#038;h=224\" alt=\"img_49361 - WordPress Las Vegas - photography by Lorelle VanFossen\" title=\"img_49361 - WordPress Las Vegas - photography by Lorelle VanFossen\" width=\"300\" height=\"224\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-3744\" /></a>A WordCamp is a day or two long event with sponsors and dozens if not hundreds of WordPress fans gathering annually. WordCamp Toronto was the first, I believe, to have a three day WordCamp event, but there are no rules. It differs from a WordPress Meetup because it is offered rarely instead of regularly.</p>\n<p>WordCamps were originally formatted on the Barcamp structure, loosely put together, grassroots gatherings of WordPress fans in a day long unconference style. While this works for some communities familiar with the unconference style, some stick with a more traditional conference format. </p>\n<p>While a WordPress Meetup can cover any topics of interest to their members, a WordCamp event is focused on WordPress for the majority of the programs and workshops.</p>\n<p>Many distinguish the two events based upon the length and speakers. WordPress Meetups tend to last a few hours where WordCamps are day long events. The speakers at WordCamps can come from your region or around the world. </p>\n<h3>How Do I Start a WordCamp or WordPress Meetup?</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://lorelle.files.wordpress.com/2008/04/cali-neal-talk.jpg\"><img src=\"http://lorelle.files.wordpress.com/2008/04/cali-neal-talk.jpg?w=300&#038;h=189\" alt=\"Cali and Neal talk about Video blogging with WordPress at WordCamp Dallas\" title=\"Cali and Neal talk about Video blogging with WordPress at WordCamp Dallas\" width=\"300\" height=\"189\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-2458\" /></a>If you would like to sponsor or host a WordCamp, check out the new official site for tracking WordCamps is <a title=\"WordCamp Central\" href=\"http://central.wordcamp.org/\">WordCamp Central</a>, which includes instructions and <a title=\"run your own WordCamp\" href=\"http://central.wordcamp.org/guidelines/\">guidelines for running a WordCamp</a>. There are also articles with tips and techniques for WordPress Meetups and WordCamps on <a title=\"The WordCamp Report\" href=\"http://wordcamp.info/\">The WordCamp Report</a>, as well as on blogs by those who have run these events.</p>\n<p>In general, you need to have a team of at least 5 active volunteers, a location and date, speakers, sponsors, and food or easy access to food. The rest of it is up to you.</p>\n<p>Get a free blog on <a title=\"WordPress.com free blogs\" rel=\"tag\" href=\"http://www.wordpress.com/\">WordPress.com</a> or host your own for the WordCamp, until WordCamp Central finishes setting up their WordPressMU blog network. Get a Twitter account and add a listing to the <a title=\"Event search for wordpress\" href=\"http://upcoming.yahoo.com/search/?type=Events&amp;q=wordpress\">Yahoo Upcoming events for WordPress</a> and <a title=\"WordPress upcoming events\" href=\"http://wordpress.meetup.com/events/upcoming/\">WordPress Meetups Upcoming Events</a> and tag them &#8220;WordPress Events&#8221; and &#8220;WordCamp. These are tracked by many WordPress fans around the world, many whom are willing to fly in to the various WordPress and WordCamp events.</p>\n<h3>How Do I Get WordPress Rock Stars to My WordPress Event?</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://lorelle.files.wordpress.com/2008/04/mattm-johnp.jpg\"><img src=\"http://lorelle.files.wordpress.com/2008/04/mattm-johnp.jpg?w=245&#038;h=300\" alt=\"John Pozadzides and Matt Mullenweg at WordCamp Dallas\" title=\"John Pozadzides and Matt Mullenweg at WordCamp Dallas\" width=\"245\" height=\"300\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-2475\" /></a>While <a title=\"Matt Mullenweg\" rel=\"tag\" href=\"http://ma.tt/\">Matt Mullenweg</a>, myself, and other representatives of WordPress and <a title=\"Automattic - parent company of WordPress, WordPress.com, Akismet, BuddyPress, and more\" rel=\"tag\" href=\"http://www.automattic.com/\">Automattic</a> try to get to as many WordCamp and WordPress events as we can, look to your own neighborhood and community for your own WordPress experts and rock stars.</p>\n<p>Many think it helps to have a &#8220;big name&#8221; to help attract attendees. In some large cities it does, but promote the event as a chance to learn about how to use WordPress in your business or personal life, and you&#8217;d be stunned at the number of people who will show up, just because they love WordPress.</p>\n<p>To ask one of the press-o-rati, contact them through their blogs, email or Twitter accounts. To request someone officially from Automattic or WordPress, use the <a title=\"Contact Us\" href=\"http://central.wordcamp.org/contact-us/\">WordCamp Central contact form</a> and ask. You can be vague and invite whoever is willing to come, or be specific and request someone who is an expert in WordPress Themes, Plugins, BuddyPress, bbPress, PollDaddy, Intense Debate, or any of the other WordPress and Automattic specific features and services.</p>\n<p>I highly recommend you make your WordCamp and WordPress event about your community. WordCamp/Podcamp Hawaii brought in local social media experts, musicians, and tourist industry representatives familiar with WordPress to speak to attendees, giving them the local perspective that their community needs. WordCamp Toronto brought in members of the local art community to display interactive art work and held community competitions for the event logo, blog designs, and Plugins, involving as many people and groups as possible to make the event a social one. WordCamp San Francisco 2008 had a fund-raising event &#8220;Scavenger Hunt&#8221; for a local educational charity on the day after the WordCamp sessions.</p>\n<p>There are a lot of ways you can involve your community and help others blog and share their voice with the world and benefit your community in general. Make your WordPress event inclusive not exclusive</p>\n<p>To publicize your WordPress event or WordCamp, contact <a title=\"Contact Us\" href=\"http://central.wordcamp.org/contact-us/\">WordCamp Central</a>, <a title=\"The WordCamp Report\" href=\"http://wordcamp.info/\">The WordCamp Report</a>, <a title=\"Event search for wordpress\" href=\"http://upcoming.yahoo.com/search/?type=Events&amp;q=wordpress\">Yahoo Upcoming events for WordPress</a>, <a title=\"WordPress upcoming events\" href=\"http://wordpress.meetup.com/events/upcoming/\">WordPress Meetups Upcoming Events</a>, and Upcoming events tagged with &#8220;<a title=\"Upcoming: Public events tagged with \">WordCamp</a>&#8221;

Registration is closed at over 700 attendees for this one day event packed with a ton of the top blogging, social media, search engine, business, and WordPress experts. I&#8217;ll be there, so be sure and find me for a hug.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s part of the joy and difference between a WordPress event and other social tech events. WordPressers serve up hugs, not just hand shakes. What I hear over and over again at these events is how we all <em>know</em> each other, so meeting face to face is just another step in the relationship process that began a few months to a few years ago. We&#8217;re already friends!</p>\n<p>This year so far it has been my honor to be included and speaking at a variety of WordCamp events including <a title=\"WordCamp Las Vegas\" href=\"http://lasvegaswordcamp.com/\">WordCamp Las Vegas</a>, <a title=\"WordCamp Whistler 2009\" href=\"http://wordcampwhistler.com/\">WordCamp Whistler</a>, <a title=\"WordCamp Toronto\" href=\"http://phug.ca/wordcamptoronto\">WordCamp Toronto</a>, and <a title=\"WordCamp Columbus\" href=\"http://www.wordcampcolumbus.com/\">WordCamp Columbus</a>, and you will probably find me rattling around <a title=\"WordCamp Dallas\" href=\"http://dallas.wordcamp.org/\">WordCamp Dallas</a>, <a title=\"WordCamp Portland\" href=\"http://www.wordcampportland.com/\">WordCamp Portland</a>, <a title=\"WordCamp Seattle\" href=\"http://www.wordcampseattle.org/\">WordCamp Seattle</a>, <a title=\"WordCamp NL\" href=\"http://wordcampnl.org/\">Netherlands &#8211; WordCamp NL</a>, WordCamp Israel, and WordCamp/Podcamp Hawaii.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://lorelle.files.wordpress.com/2009/01/img_49341.jpg\"><img src=\"http://lorelle.files.wordpress.com/2009/01/img_49341.jpg?w=300&#038;h=224\" alt=\"img_49341 - WordCamp Las Vegas - photography by Lorelle VanFossen\" title=\"img_49341 - WordCamp Las Vegas - photography by Lorelle VanFossen\" width=\"300\" height=\"224\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-3742\" /></a>According to the <a title=\"WordPress Meetup Groups\" href=\"http://wordpress.meetup.com/\">WordPress Meetup Groups</a> on Meetup.com, there are 32 Meetup Groups focused specifically on WordPress, representing 3,394 Members in 5 different countries among 32 Meetup groups in 28 different cities.

are shouting out for one in their area. <a title=\"Copenhagen\" href=\"http://wordpress.meetup.com/cities/dk/copenhagen/\">Copenhagen</a> (61 interested), <a title=\"Philadelphia, PA\" href=\"http://wordpress.meetup.com/cities/us/pa/philadelphia/\">Philadelphia</a> (45), <a title=\"Houston, TX\" href=\"http://wordpress.meetup.com/cities/us/tx/houston/\">Houston</a>, <a title=\"London\" href=\"http://wordpress.meetup.com/cities/gb/london/\">London</a>, and <a title=\"Denver, CO\" href=\"http://wordpress.meetup.com/cities/us/co/denver/\">Denver</a> are among the many. Some of these have had or are about to have a WordCamp event, so why aren&#8217;t there regular WordPress meetups?</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://lorelle.files.wordpress.com/2009/05/wordcampmeetups-map.jpg\"><img src=\"http://lorelle.files.wordpress.com/2009/05/wordcampmeetups-map.jpg?w=300&#038;h=263\" alt=\"WordCamp Meetups Map at Meetups.com\" title=\"WordCamp Meetups Map at Meetups.com\" width=\"300\" height=\"263\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-4101\" /></a><a title=\"WordPress Meetup Groups\" href=\"http://wordpress.meetup.com/\">WordPress Meetup Groups</a> on Meetup.com offers a map of all the places where there are WordPress events and activities and where ones are wanted. You can <a title=\"browse all cities\" href=\"http://wordpress.meetup.com/cities/\">browse a list of cities hosting WordPress events</a> or go directly to your region to find out where one is or who might be interested in putting one together.</p>\n<h3>What is the Difference Between a WordPress Meetup and WordCamp?</h3>\n<p>A WordPress Meetup is a frequent meeting of WordPress fans. If you would like to start a WordPress Meetup group, find a meeting place and announce it among your friends, and add a listing to the <a title=\"Event search for wordpress\" href=\"http://upcoming.yahoo.com/search/?type=Events&amp;q=wordpress\">Yahoo Upcoming events for WordPress</a> and <a title=\"WordPress upcoming events\" href=\"http://wordpress.meetup.com/events/upcoming/\">WordPress Meetups Upcoming Events</a> and tag them &#8220;WordPress Events&#8221; and &#8220;WordPress&#8221;, as many track WordPress event announcements there.</p>\n<p>A WordPress Meetup allows locals to get together and learn from each other on how to use WordPress. There are formal WordPress meetups and informal ones, covering nothing but WordPress or including WordPress as part of other topics on web publishing and social media. WordPress meetups are usually held monthly or quarterly. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://lorelle.files.wordpress.com/2009/01/img_49361.jpg\"><img src=\"http://lorelle.files.wordpress.com/2009/01/img_49361.jpg?w=300&#038;h=224\" alt=\"img_49361 - WordPress Las Vegas - photography by Lorelle VanFossen\" title=\"img_49361 - WordPress Las Vegas - photography by Lorelle VanFossen\" width=\"300\" height=\"224\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-3744\" /></a>A WordCamp is a day or two long event with sponsors and dozens if not hundreds of WordPress fans gathering annually. WordCamp Toronto was the first, I believe, to have a three day WordCamp event, but there are no rules. It differs from a WordPress Meetup because it is offered rarely instead of regularly.</p>\n<p>WordCamps were originally formatted on the Barcamp structure, loosely put together, grassroots gatherings of WordPress fans in a day long unconference style. While this works for some communities familiar with the unconference style, some stick with a more traditional conference format. </p>\n<p>While a WordPress Meetup can cover any topics of interest to their members, a WordCamp event is focused on WordPress for the majority of the programs and workshops.</p>\n<p>Many distinguish the two events based upon the length and speakers. WordPress Meetups tend to last a few hours where WordCamps are day long events. The speakers at WordCamps can come from your region or around the world. </p>\n<h3>How Do I Start a WordCamp or WordPress Meetup?</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://lorelle.files.wordpress.com/2008/04/cali-neal-talk.jpg\"><img src=\"http://lorelle.files.wordpress.com/2008/04/cali-neal-talk.jpg?w=300&#038;h=189\" alt=\"Cali and Neal talk about Video blogging with WordPress at WordCamp Dallas\" title=\"Cali and Neal talk about Video blogging with WordPress at WordCamp Dallas\" width=\"300\" height=\"189\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-2458\" /></a>If you would like to sponsor or host a WordCamp, check out the new official site for tracking WordCamps is <a title=\"WordCamp Central\" href=\"http://central.wordcamp.org/\">WordCamp Central</a>, which includes instructions and <a title=\"run your own WordCamp\" href=\"http://central.wordcamp.org/guidelines/\">guidelines for running a WordCamp</a>. There are also articles with tips and techniques for WordPress Meetups and WordCamps on <a title=\"The WordCamp Report\" href=\"http://wordcamp.info/\">The WordCamp Report</a>, as well as on blogs by those who have run these events.</p>\n<p>In general, you need to have a team of at least 5 active volunteers, a location and date, speakers, sponsors, and food or easy access to food. The rest of it is up to you.</p>\n<p>Get a free blog on <a title=\"WordPress.com free blogs\" rel=\"tag\" href=\"http://www.wordpress.com/\">WordPress.com</a> or host your own for the WordCamp, until WordCamp Central finishes setting up their WordPressMU blog network. Get a Twitter account and add a listing to the <a title=\"Event search for wordpress\" href=\"http://upcoming.yahoo.com/search/?type=Events&amp;q=wordpress\">Yahoo Upcoming events for WordPress</a> and <a title=\"WordPress upcoming events\" href=\"http://wordpress.meetup.com/events/upcoming/\">WordPress Meetups Upcoming Events</a> and tag them &#8220;WordPress Events&#8221; and &#8220;WordCamp. These are tracked by many WordPress fans around the world, many whom are willing to fly in to the various WordPress and WordCamp events.</p>\n<h3>How Do I Get WordPress Rock Stars to My WordPress Event?</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://lorelle.files.wordpress.com/2008/04/mattm-johnp.jpg\"><img src=\"http://lorelle.files.wordpress.com/2008/04/mattm-johnp.jpg?w=245&#038;h=300\" alt=\"John Pozadzides and Matt Mullenweg at WordCamp Dallas\" title=\"John Pozadzides and Matt Mullenweg at WordCamp Dallas\" width=\"245\" height=\"300\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-2475\" /></a>While <a title=\"Matt Mullenweg\" rel=\"tag\" href=\"http://ma.tt/\">Matt Mullenweg</a>, myself, and other representatives of WordPress and <a title=\"Automattic - parent company of WordPress, WordPress.com, Akismet, BuddyPress, and more\" rel=\"tag\" href=\"http://www.automattic.com/\">Automattic</a> try to get to as many WordCamp and WordPress events as we can, look to your own neighborhood and community for your own WordPress experts and rock stars.</p>\n<p>Many think it helps to have a &#8220;big name&#8221; to help attract attendees. In some large cities it does, but promote the event as a chance to learn about how to use WordPress in your business or personal life, and you&#8217;d be stunned at the number of people who will show up, just because they love WordPress.</p>\n<p>To ask one of the press-o-rati, contact them through their blogs, email or Twitter accounts. To request someone officially from Automattic or WordPress, use the <a title=\"Contact Us\" href=\"http://central.wordcamp.org/contact-us/\">WordCamp Central contact form</a> and ask. You can be vague and invite whoever is willing to come, or be specific and request someone who is an expert in WordPress Themes, Plugins, BuddyPress, bbPress, PollDaddy, Intense Debate, or any of the other WordPress and Automattic specific features and services.</p>\n<p>I highly recommend you make your WordCamp and WordPress event about your community. WordCamp/Podcamp Hawaii brought in local social media experts, musicians, and tourist industry representatives familiar with WordPress to speak to attendees, giving them the local perspective that their community needs. WordCamp Toronto brought in members of the local art community to display interactive art work and held community competitions for the event logo, blog designs, and Plugins, involving as many people and groups as possible to make the event a social one. WordCamp San Francisco 2008 had a fund-raising event &#8220;Scavenger Hunt&#8221; for a local educational charity on the day after the WordCamp sessions.</p>\n<p>There are a lot of ways you can involve your community and help others blog and share their voice with the world and benefit your community in general. Make your WordPress event inclusive not exclusive</p>\n<p>To publicize your WordPress event or WordCamp, contact <a title=\"Contact Us\" href=\"http://central.wordcamp.org/contact-us/\">WordCamp Central</a>, <a title=\"The WordCamp Report\" href=\"http://wordcamp.info/\">The WordCamp Report</a>, <a title=\"Event search for wordpress\" href=\"http://upcoming.yahoo.com/search/?type=Events&amp;q=wordpress\">Yahoo Upcoming events for WordPress</a>, <a title=\"WordPress upcoming events\" href=\"http://wordpress.meetup.com/events/upcoming/\">WordPress Meetups Upcoming Events</a>, and Upcoming events tagged with &#8220;<a title=\"Upcoming: Public events tagged with \">WordCamp</a>&#8221;

Lets take a look at five of these plugins and see what they can do for your WordPress based website:</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/dynamic-headers/\">Dynamic Headers</a>: This plugin was just made public in late April of this year and it is extremely popular having been downloaded 3,770 times in the last three weeks.&#160; The Dynamic Headers plugin allows you to manage what media is shown in your header on each page and/or post.&#160; This plugin allows the use of any image file and also Flash (.swf) files so it is up to your imagination on what you can do.&#160; The possibilities are quite endless.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/flickr-gallery/\">flickr Gallery</a>: Another very popular plugin with 18,383 total downloads to date.&#160; This plugin integrates your flickr account with your WordPress website by utilizing shortcodes in WordPress version 2.5 and above.

Deprecated should be deprecated from email subject lines, as should negative sounding email subjects.</p>\n<p>The meat of the email is the second half (<strong>emphasis</strong> mine):</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8230;</p>\n<p>We will provide an easy-to-use migration path to move the data to the provided replacements.  We will also provide dumps of this data in case<br />\nprojects want to do something different with their data.  Additional information on how to obtain or migrate your data will be provided when the<br />\ntimeline is announced, in a future mailing.</p>\n<p>The following applications are due to be deprecated, replaced by <strong>high-quality Open Source applications</strong> we have in our Hosted Apps offering:</p>\n<p>* TaskManager will be replaced by TaskFreak!, dotProject and <strong>Trac</strong><br />\n(tickets).<br />\n* DocManager will be replaced by MediaWiki and Trac (wiki).<br />\n* Discussion Forums will be replaced by phpBB.<br />\n* Diary and Notes will be replaced by <strong>WordPress</strong>.</p>\n<p>To solicit your feedback on how the migration should be handled, and alternate options you would like us to consider, we are running a survey<br />\nfor the next 30 days for the user base of each of these applications.  For links to the surveys, please see our Site Status post at:<br />\nhttp://tinyurl.com/q3g8o3</p></blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://trac.edgewall.org/\">Trac</a> and <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/\">WordPress</a> (really!) are two of my favorite open source web applications. And all of the applications in that list are highly regarded.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s fantastic to see SourceForge getting back to open source &#8212; ironic, no. It will be interesting to see how active they are in particulating in those projects. I dont&#8217; think I&#8217;ve seen any SorceForge team members participating recently on <a href=\"http://core.trac.wordpress.org/\">WordPress&#8217;s Bug Tracker (Trac)</a>.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s also fantastic to see SourceForge engaging their community by <a href=\"http://apps.sourceforge.net/wordpress/sourceforge/2009/05/12/upcoming-feature-deprecation-built-in-forums-docmanager-task-manager/\">posting this</a> on a WordPress powered blog and also using surveys to solicite feedback about the migrations and the tool choices.</p>\n<p>I would love to find out how long this change has been in the works and what people made it happen.</p>\n<p>I also notice that SourceForge&#8217;s own documentation is now in a trac wiki.

Mackenzie (Mac) Cowell led-off the night with an overview of recent history in biological engineering, and asked the question: Can molecular biology or biotechnology be a hobby?  Will advancements in synthetic biology be the tipping point that enables DIYers and garagistas to make meaningful contributions to the biological sciences, outside of traditional institutions?   Can <a href=\"http://www.diybio.org/\">DIYbio.org</a> be the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homebrew_Computer_Club\">Homebrew Computer Club</a> of biology?<br /><br />Noting that he was a recent expatriate from the institutional setting himself, Mac wondered out loud whether he would ever again be able to wield a pipette.  A proliferation of projects and protocols available online make his prospects, and the prospects of the 25 or so individuals attending the first DIYbio meeting, quite good.<br /><br />Over the noisy background of Thursday night pub chatter, just a few blocks from MIT, attendees around the room took a few moments to introduce themselves and their interests.  \"I\'ve been a software engineer my whole life and I\'m looking for something new,\" said one attendee, who was accompanied by his enthusiastic teenage son.  Also present were a dozen or so graduate students, several software engineers, journalist and her boyfriend, and even a few professors from Harvard and MIT.<br /><br />Mac flipped through slides indicating that \"<a href=\"http://makezine.com/07/\">backyard biology</a>\" is alive and well.  One illustrated guide found online describes how to <a href=\"http://vesolt.free.fr/dna.htm\">isolate DNA</a> using chemicals found in every kitchen cupboard.  Need more DNA?  A <a href=\"http://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn11763&amp;feedId=online-news_rss20\">$10 PCR device</a> assembled from <a href=\"http://www.scribd.com/doc/104545/Mini-PCR-Machine\">basic parts</a> might do the trick.  And a recipe from the pages of MAKE magazine provides the know-how for armchair anthropologists to combine a few legos, a source of current, and a cheap enzyme kit to generate <a href=\"http://makezine.com/07/fingerprinting/\">DNA fingerprints</a>.<br /><br />While backyard biology promises to be an avenue for individuals to flex their intellectual muscles and explore the molecular world around them, Jason Bobe argued that the possible impacts of a DIY world go well beyond that.  Amateurs and hobbyists are making significant contributions to engineering, environmental sensing, and even medical devices.<br /><br />A ham-radio hacker, turned reluctant cancer patient, recently combined his expertise about radio waves with spare parts from his home to build a <a href=\"http://gizmodo.com/379952/guy-invents-potential-cancer-cure-with-radio-machine-built-out-of-pie-pans-and-hot-dogs\">prototype device</a> capable of targeting the destruction of cancer cells.  This device is undergoing clinical trials at two major medical research centers, after attracting investments from venture capitalists and the collaboration of a Nobel Laureate who was intrigued by preliminary results generated from the DIYers garage.<br /><br />Undergraduate participants of <a href=\"http://igem.org/\">iGEM</a> are increasingly capable of engineering biological systems that have the potential to do real work in the world.  <a href=\"http://www.technologyreview.com/read_article.aspx?id=17716\">Banana-scented E. coli</a> might be fun, but <a href=\"http://parts2.mit.edu/wiki/index.php/Arsenic_Biosensor\">arsenic sensing bacteria</a> for identifying contaminated water supplies might actually save lives.  If undergraduates are able to design these systems, who else might?<br /><br />Model organisms like E. coli are still frustratingly difficult to engineer, even for professional biologists.  \"If amateurs can help make biological engineering more reliable, I certainly would find that of value,\" a graduate student remarked, half-jokingly.  \"I would think that amateurs would prefer to experiment with organisms that can be more readily inspected without expensive instruments,\" said another.  \"Forget E. coli.  They\'re too microscopic.  How about a plant, like <a href=\"http://openwetware.org/wiki/Physcomitrella_patens\">moss</a>?\"<br /><br />Jason cautioned that not everyone is ready to embrace a DIY biotech culture.  In NYC, a <a href=\"http://future.iftf.org/2008/01/use-a-sensor-go.html\">proposal</a> is currently under review that would make possession of environmental sensing devices a potential criminal offense.  Tom Knight, an MIT professor and open source biology advocate, reminded the crowd of the recent attempt to prosecute artist <a href=\"http://www.10zenmonkeys.com/2007/09/26/art-or-bioterrorism-who-cares/\">Steve Kurtz</a> for his home biology projects.  \"Is biological engineering fundamentally more dangerous than the risks posed by other fields, such as mechanical engineering?\" asked John Cumbers, a graduate student at Brown University.<br /><br />Mac proposed organizing a Boston-based bio-workshop for sharing equipment, space, and other resources.  He flashed a few screenshots of <a href=\"http://techshop.ws/\">Techshop</a>, a west coast organization that has established nine shared workspaces for amateur technologists.   \"This same model could work for biotechnology hobbyists,\" he added.<br /><br />-Jason Bobe<br />Report from the 1st DIYbio.org meet-up<br />Thursday May 1st, 2008<br />Asgard\'s Pub (Cambridge, MA)','Don\'t Phage Me, Bro',0,'','publish','open','open','','dont-phage-me-bro','','','2008-05-24 20:31:00','2008-05-25 01:31:00','',0,'http://localhost/blog/?p=3',0,'post','',1),(4,1,'2008-06-07 11:01:00','0000-00-00 00:00:00','Hey all,<br /><br />The MAKE zine blog featured this awesome diy electronics kit recently: http://blog.makezine.com/archive/2008/06/sparkle_labs_diy_electron.html.<br /><br />I think one of the main projects of DIYbio should develop a bio version, complete with an illustrated manual of diy protocols and instructions for building rudimentary equipment.','Sparkle Labs electronics kit is a model for a DIYbio kit',0,'','draft','open','open','','','','','2008-06-07 11:01:00','0000-00-00 00:00:00','',0,'http://localhost/blog/?p=4',0,'post','',0),(5,1,'2008-07-09 22:55:00','2008-07-10 03:55:00','<object classid=\"clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000\" width=\"400\" height=\"302\" codebase=\"http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0\"><param name=\"allowfullscreen\" value=\"true\" /><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\" /><param name=\"src\" value=\"http://www.vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=1087631&amp;server=www.vimeo.com&amp;show_title=1&amp;show_byline=1&amp;show_portrait=0&amp;color=&amp;fullscreen=1\" /><embed type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"400\" height=\"302\" src=\"http://www.vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=1087631&amp;server=www.vimeo.com&amp;show_title=1&amp;show_byline=1&amp;show_portrait=0&amp;color=&amp;fullscreen=1\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"></embed></object><br /><a href=\"http://www.vimeo.com/1087631?pg=embed&amp;sec=1087631\">DIYbio in 5 minutes - O\'Reilly ignite Boston</a> from <a href=\"http://www.vimeo.com/user383013?pg=embed&amp;sec=1087631\">mac cowell</a> on <a href=\"http://vimeo.com?pg=embed&amp;sec=1087631\">Vimeo</a>.<br /><br />Here is an overview of DIYbio in 5 minutes - recorded at <a href=\"http://ignite.oreilly.com/2008/06/ignite-boston-3-files-uploaded.html\">O\'Reilly\'s Ignite Boston 2008</a>.','DIYbio in 5 minutes - O\'Reilly Ignite Boston 2008',0,'','publish','open','open','','diybio-in-5-minutes-oreilly-ignite-boston-2008','','','2008-07-09 22:55:00','2008-07-10 03:55:00','',0,'http://localhost/blog/?p=5',0,'post','',3),(6,1,'2008-07-14 21:48:00','2008-07-15 02:48:00','Thanks to everyone for a great meeting: Michael, Jason, Sophia, Benny, Topher, Ricardo, Alex, Alec, <a href=\"http://nublabs.com/\">nublabs</a>, and everyone else.<br /><br />Overview:<br />DIYbio 2 &amp; 3 were focused on gel electrophoresis - we started by researching all the amateur gel protocols we could find online (notably <a href=\"http://www.scq.ubc.ca/the-macgyver-project-genomic-dna-extraction-and-gel-electrophoresis-experiments-using-everyday-materials/\">the  MacGuyver Project</a> and the <a href=\"http://makezine.com/07/fingerprinting/\">MAKE protocol</a>, the latter of which we decided to focus on) and <a href=\"http://groups.google.com/group/diybio/web/gel-electrophoresis-shopping-list\">making a shopping list of materials</a> we would need to build the complete gel apparatus, make a gel, and stain DNA.  We got Agar agar powder from a health food store on ebay and Potato Dextrose Agar and sybr green from a lab equipment reseller on ebay.<br /><br />Basically we<a href=\"http://flickr.com/photos/macowell/2659555835/in/pool-diybio\"> over-stained the gels with methylene blue</a> and couldn\'t visualize anything because the entire gel was a solid blue.<br /><a onblur=\"try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}\" href=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3010/2659555835_2d62b21be6_m_d.jpg\"><img style=\"margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 252px; height: 169px;\" src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3010/2659555835_2d62b21be6_m_d.jpg\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></a><br /><br />Also, we used metals that were way too reactive as electrodes in the gel box and the redox reaction that they enjoyed probably ruined the voltage field across the gel.<br /><br /><img src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3278/2660365638_e39b9e0ee0_m_d.jpg\" alt=\"The completed boxes with buffer and gel about 30 minutes into the run using 54 volts (6 9-volts in series).  You can see the cathodes undergoing some redox reaction, leaking copper ions everywhere.\" /><br /><br />That said, I think we accomplished a lot, learned a lot, and somehow managed to do everything the protocol required in a spontaneous, parallel way - to me, that was the best part about the event.  I remember stepping back at one point and being amazed at how well everyone was working together without any central plan: Topher and Jason were improvising with the stovetop and microwave to boil the agar, Sophia and Mike were cutting up charlie cards to make gel combs, and Benny, Ricardo, and the nublabs crew were constructing and taping gel trays and boxes.  It was awesome.<br /><br />What I learned:<br />1. We were not as rigorous with the materials as we needed to be.  One of our main problems was getting the concentration of the gel just right, which was difficult because the packages for our agar didn\'t list the original concentrations.  In general, we followed the MAKE protocol too specifically while using supplies that came with ambiguous descriptions at best.  DIYbio protocols we develop should be designed to help the user understand the basic principles of the operation in a way that enables them to improvise successfully with non-standard materials.<br /><br />2. We should have had a solid understanding of how to dispose of all the materials involved before beginning as well as exactly what the potential risks involved were (very low - probably the biggest risk was spilling molten agar) and what to do in case something went wrong.<br /><br />3. It would have been better to have built all the equipment in one meeting and then used it in a second.  Trying to do both was a little too long.<br /><br />Next week we are going on a tour of the Boston FabLab, courtesy of our friends at NubLabs - meet at the FabLab at 7:00pm on Thursday, 17 July 2008.<br /><br />See you then!<br /><br />Mac<br /><br />p.s. go comment on the flickr photos!','DIYbio 3 - Gel Electrophoresis',0,'','publish','open','open','','diybio-3-gel-electrophoresis','','','2008-07-14 21:48:00','2008-07-15 02:48:00','',0,'http://localhost/blog/?p=6',0,'post','',1),(7,1,'2008-07-15 16:28:00','2008-07-15 21:28:00','Some scientists are really making an effort to make their own labs environmentally benign.  I discovered the term in reference to Angela Belcher\'s work using <a href=\"http://spectrum.mit.edu/issue/2005-fall/building-on-nature/ \">environmentally benign viruses</a>. <br /><br />One goal for amateur biologists and DIYers is to figure out how to operate in ways that are \"environmentally benign\", especially in the following areas:<br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">(1) REAGENTS</span>: Can they be stored safely?<br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">(2) EXPERIMENTAL OUTCOMES</span>: This may be most important for SynBio experiments.  Anything that cannot live in the backyard, or safely go down the sink, might be a problem for researchers at home (and their neighbors).    <br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">(3) WASTE</span>: Unlike institutional scientists, amateur biologist working at home may not have access to appropriate waste disposal, other than say, a workroom sink and a trash can.<br /><br />For DIYbio to be accepted as a hobby that is permissible for members of any local community to engage-in, concerns about environmental impact and safety will need to be addressed.

The peculiar feature of this renaissance is that its going to take place outside of \"science proper\", away from the universities which dominate now, and funded out-of-pocket by enthusiasts without PhDs.    <br /><br />The democratization of technologies will enable more people to do their own science: make hypotheses, design experiments, collect large data sets, and apply a mixture of reasoning and cloud computing to make discoveries.  Perhaps we\'ll see a multi-author journal article published written entirely by people without PhDs and no institutional affiliations.  Although it sounds crazy, I\'m not sure it is.<br /><br />Today <a href=\"http://www.genome-technology.com/issues/blog/general/148979-1.html\">GTO</a> pointed to a New York Times article about a few a high school students that were curious to know whether patrons of NYC restaurants and grocers were getting the seafood they ordered, or if instead, some foods were often substituted by others.  So, they collected seafood specimens and sent them for genotyping.  <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/22/science/22fish.html?_r=1&oref=slogin\">One quarter of the fish they collected were mislabeled</a>.  What these high school students were able to do is remarkable, and more projects like it will soon follow:  <br /><br /><blockquote>\"What may be most impressive about the experiment is the ease with which the students accomplished it. Although the [genetic] testing technique is at the forefront of research, the fact that anyone can take advantage of it by sending samples off to a laboratory meant the kind of investigative tools once restricted to Ph.D.’s and crime labs can move into the hands of curious diners and amateur scientists everywhere.\" </blockquote><br /><br />How far might the paradigm of DIYscience be extended?  Could amateur biologists around the world organize around a grass-roots experiment, collect specimens, generate and share data, and make discoveries?  What might that experiment look like?<br /><br />-Jason Bobe','Science without Scientists',0,'','publish','open','open','','science-without-scientists','','','2008-08-22 15:16:00','2008-08-22 20:16:00','',0,'http://localhost/blog/?p=8',0,'post','',0),(9,1,'2008-10-11 11:00:00','2008-10-11 16:00:00','We had a great summer getting DIYbio off the ground.  A suspicion that the era of DIY biology was upon us led to a kick-off meeting at Asgard\'s pub in Cambridge only 5 short months ago.  In the months that followed, we investigated simple DIY protocols like DNA extraction and gel electrophoresis, we hacked what we could, shared ideas about what the future might hold, and even managed to get a little press.  There is even a group of DIYbioers springing up on the west coast.  Yay!<br /><br />So, what\'s next for DIYbio?  Come find out, share your ideas, and learn how to get involved on Thursday, October 16th from 7-9pm, in room 56-114 at MIT (<a href=\"http://whereis.mit.edu/map-jpg?selection=56&Buildings=go\">see map</a>).  Everyone is invited!  Yes, everyone!  Bring new people!  Let\'s fill up the auditorium!<br /><br />The evening will begin with a few short lightning-style talks on projects we\'re embarking on for 2008-2009, including:<br /><br />1. <strong>Public Wetlab (Mac Cowell)</strong>: A lab where anyone can learn how to tinker with biology and get hands-on training in cutting edge techniques.  Let\'s work on a project for iGEM 2009 in this space. Let\'s boot up the lab by on our own or partner with an existing school.  And let\'s set a standard of safety, responsibility and transparency for the bio-maker community.<br /><br />2. <strong>FlashLabs BioWeatherMap (Jason Bobe)</strong>: Flash mobs meet consumer-generated science in the new DIYbio initiative FlashLabs, where we\'ll be pulling-off a new large-scale collaborative science project annually for amateurs and enthusiasts worldwide.  First up: the BioWeatherMap.  Ever wonder how the microbial communities living on cross-walk buttons in Boston compare to those in San Francisco, or Manhattan, or the cross-walk nearest your home?  We\'re going to find out and you can get involved.  Self-assembly required!<br /><br />3. <strong>Smart Lab (Jason Morrison)</strong>: Hardware hacking lab instruments, large-format multitouch displays, and a physical computing interface with real-time sample tracking and data logging meets a beautiful and natural way for scientists to learn, research, visualize, and share their work.  Intelligent and interactive protocol guides, intuitive data manipulation and transformation, and livestreaming your science to an electronic lab notebook are a few components of this cross-disciplinary project.  And go open source or go home!<br /><br />Would you like to present an idea for a DIYbio project or share your thoughts?  Email us, or post a comment here!  We have a couple of extra 5-minute slots available.  We\'ll also reserve time for discussion about DIYbio as a community and an organization, including issues related to openness and safety.','DIYbio Meetup in Boston on Thursday, October 16',0,'','publish','open','open','','diybio-meetup-in-boston-on-thursday-october-16','','','2008-10-11 11:00:00','2008-10-11 16:00:00','',0,'http://localhost/blog/?p=9',0,'post','',0),(10,1,'2008-10-11 11:08:00','0000-00-00 00:00:00','* Oct 4: SHDH DIYbio meetup.<br /><br />* Meredith Folks who are interested in open-source bioinformatics programming:<br />there\'s a week-long workshop coming up in Durham, NC this December<br />(tentatively 8-12, but could be the first week) about evolutionary<br />database interoperabiility -- they\'re actually calling it a Hackathon,<br />and it will be a hands-on, Make Stuff Happen deal.<br />https://www.nescent.org/wg/evoinfo/index.php?title=Database_Interop_H...<br />for more info.
